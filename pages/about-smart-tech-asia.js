            <strong>SmartCards Expo</strong>&nbsp;is now&nbsp;
            <strong>SmartTech Asia!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            SmartCards Expo, as India&rsquo;s only trade fair for this industry,
            has seen unprecedented success in the past two decades along with
            its cluster of co-located shows on RFID, biometrics, e-security,
            IoT, AI and digital payments. We have rebranded this cluster of
            trade fairs under a single name&nbsp;
            <strong>&lsquo;SmartTech Asia&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;to represent
            identification, authentication, and digital payment technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new name resonates with smart technologies and offers an
            opportunity to include new segments and sub-segments within the
            larger spectrum and also enhance engagement with the industry. We
            are delighted with the success of this latest edition of SmartCards
            Expo 2022, and we are confident of more success with SmartTech Asia
            in the forthcoming editions
          </p>

            Launched in 1999, SmartCards Expo was acquired by Messe Muenchen
            India in April 2018 as a part of its international expansion
            strategy. It is India&rsquo;s only trade fair focusing on smart card
            technologies and is organized along with the co-located trade fairs
            IoT India Expo, e-Security Expo, RFID India Expo, Biometrics India
            Expo, Digital Payments India Expo and Artificial Intelligence India
            Expo.

            The Indian industry will witness an upsurge in the demand for the
            emerging digital technologies and services in the coming years. The
            recent initiatives by the Indian government to foster best-in-class
            infrastructure for developing the industries will lead to adoption
            of smart factories, thereby further boosting the need for advanced
            technologies.
